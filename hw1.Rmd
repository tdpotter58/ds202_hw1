  Something I would consider to be data science is the study of advanced statistics in the sport of baseball, known as **Sabermetrics**. Teams use statasticians to study the trends of players on their team and around the league, such as the [Home Run Rate per Year](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/home-run-rate.png), in order to get a better understanding of the way the game is changing and how to better mold their team to win.
